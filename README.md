- 👋 Hi, I’m @kpowkitty, but you can call me Kat!
- 👀 I’m interested in operating systems, game engines, AI/ML, and well, all things computing!
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at Planet Bee Foundation, designing Micro:bits with makecode
        in combination with a classroom curriculum to bring coding & conservation efforts to students accross America!
- 🌱🌱 I'm also a research assistant at San Francisco State University for Dr. El Alaoui. We are studying how to use ML/FBA/MM to simulate how
        plants respond to various chemical reactions.
